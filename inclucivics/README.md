##HR Reporting App - "INCLUCIVICS"

####Synopsis

The Human Relations Commission (HRC) is a non-profit governmental branch of the Metro government dedicated to promoting “equality, equity, and inclusion” for “all people in Nashville and Davidson County”.

The HRC has requested the brigade's help in creating a website to visualize and track Metro employee demographics data.  The dataset to be visualized includes salary, department, position/rank, sex, and ethnicity and is scheduled to be released and regularly updated on data.nashville.gov.

The goal of this website is to provide a transparent focal point to ensure that the cultural and ethnic makeup of Nashville's local government is reflective of the population as a whole.

The initial request asks for a website that simply provides visualizations and tracks changes in demographics data over time.  A growth potential for this project is to build a portal that provides users the opportunity to create dynamic visualizations.


####Project Specifications

Metro has approx. 60 departments that will be released by Metro's HR in a single major dataset, and approx. 5 more sub-departments/branches that will release their own datasets.

These should be timestamped, stored, and the website should provide the ability to visualize data in aggregate as well as by individual departments
Data visualizations should be automatically updated as new datasets are released and changes over time should be tracked.

There is a domain name already registered for this project by HRC. www.inclucivics.com
Hosting by Metro is unclear, probably best to handle this ourselves for now, though this does seem an obvious thing for metro to host themselves.
A primary goal is to subdivide the demographic data by rank/position.  There are effectively three tiers: lower, middle, and upper management.  Each department should have a breakdown of this data as well, but some departments do not use the same coding system and do not explicitly list rank, this could potentially be inferred by salary distributions within a given department, but this is an obstacle that needs to be considered.
Data visualizations require an accompanying table laying out the raw data.
